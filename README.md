## Book overview

[Good, but outdated overview](http://wcftutorial.net/WCF-Books.aspx)

[Programming WCF Services, 3rd Edition](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596805494.do?green=E986AA5A-B945-525F-AFB9-2C805CAAA7B1&intcmp=af-mybuy-9780596805494.IP)

[Reviews are mostly positive](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-WCF-Services-Mastering-AppFabric/product-reviews/0596805489/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending): "A WCF bible especially for the advanced topics". Book seems to be detailed and comprehensive, but does not seem suited for beginners. 

"This isn't a beginners book; the author dives down into advanced material in spots almost without notice. If you want to become proficient using WCF, you will be buying this book eventually. You will find that this book will become both a reference as well as well as a guide."

[4th edition](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032373.do) is currently in making.

[Learning WCF: A Hands-on Guide](http://www.amazon.com/Learning-WCF-A-Hands-Guide/dp/0596101627)

Seems to be very good for beginers. It's written very well and covers large amount of needed material. Published in 2007 and as such is a bit outdated. [Reviews are positive](http://www.amazon.com/Learning-WCF-A-Hands-Guide/product-reviews/0596101627/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending). 

[WCF Multi-Layer Services Development with Entity Framework, 4th Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Multi-Layer-Services-Development-Framework-Edition/dp/1784391042)

Newer book. Very good for beginers. Teaches WCF in a quick and straight-to-the-point way. May be the best option for beginer level book. [Reviews are good](http://www.amazon.com/Multi-Layer-Services-Development-Framework-Edition/product-reviews/1784391042/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending).

[WCF 4.5 Multi-Layer Services Development with Entity Framework](http://www.amazon.com/Multi-Layer-Services-Development-Entity-Framework/dp/1849687668)

Book covers WCF 4.5, current WCF version. [Reviews are mixed](http://www.amazon.com/Multi-Layer-Services-Development-Entity-Framework/product-reviews/1849687668/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending). Book is suited for beginers, but has typos and missing instruction and misses advanced level stuff.
