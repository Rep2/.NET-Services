## Book overview

[Good but outdated overview](http://wcftutorial.net/WCF-Books.aspx)

[Programming WCF Services, 3rd Edition](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596805494.do?green=E986AA5A-B945-525F-AFB9-2C805CAAA7B1&intcmp=af-mybuy-9780596805494.IP)

[Reviews are mostly positive](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-WCF-Services-Mastering-AppFabric/product-reviews/0596805489/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending): "A WCF bible especially for the advanced topics". Book seems to be detailed and comprehensive, but does not seem suited for beginners. As a reviewer wrote: "The book is quite thorough and detailed, but jumps right in to specific details that assume that you have completely mastered the basics. Don't look here if you are trying to build your first WCF application, but rather if you have one built or working, and want to delve into the finer points of security and other considerations."

"This isn't a beginners book; the author dives down into advanced material in spots almost without notice. If you want to become proficient using WCF, you will be buying this book eventually. You will find that this book will become both a reference as well as well as a guide."

[4th eddition](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032373.do) is currently in making.

[Learning WCF: A Hands-on Guide](http://www.amazon.com/Learning-WCF-A-Hands-Guide/dp/0596101627)

Seems to be the best book for begginers. It's written very well and covers large amout of needed material.[Reviews are positive](http://www.amazon.com/Learning-WCF-A-Hands-Guide/product-reviews/0596101627/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending). 


[WCF 4.5 Multi-Layer Services Development with Entity Framework](http://www.amazon.com/Multi-Layer-Services-Development-Entity-Framework/dp/1849687668)

Book covers WCF 4.5, current WCF version. [Reviews are mixed](http://www.amazon.com/Multi-Layer-Services-Development-Entity-Framework/product-reviews/1849687668/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending). Book is suited for begginers, but has typos and missing instruction and misses advanced level stuf.
